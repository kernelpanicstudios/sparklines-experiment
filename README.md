sparklines-experiment 0.1
=========================

This is an experiment to just prove out the goals of the D3 Reporting Engine we've been talkign about.  Essentially, the included javascript gives you an easy way to store your Data, and using a span in your code, you can draw a sparkline of this data.

*Disclaimer:* In terms of quality, this code is a heaping pile of shit right now.  I've not tested to make sure it works in browsers other than Chrome, and it instantly blows up JSHint.  This is not an example of good JavaScript.  We can clean it up later prior to making the repo public.
